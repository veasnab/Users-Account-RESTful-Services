## Instructions for Running Frontend and Backend (Locally on Window Visual Studio): 
1. Download the folder: "veasanb-a3" or clone it from github.
2. In Visual Studio, navigate to the "File" tab (uppder right corner), within the tab click on "Add Folder to Workspace". Locate the folder containing the files you just downloaded: Folder "veasanb-a3"; select the folder and then click the "add" button in the UI.
3. Go to the EXPLORER section on the left side of the screen in Visual studio or (short-cut: Ctrl+Shift+E).

4. Within Visual Studio, navigate to the "Terminal" tab, with this tab click on "New Terminal" or (short-cut: Ctrl+Shift+`). In the terminal UI, ensure that the directory is within the working workspace. For example: PS C:\Users\Veasna Bun\OneDrive\Desktop\veasnab-a3>, where "veasnab-a3" indicated that I am within directory where the files in step 2 is located.
5. (Note: Make sure you have the necessary software installed: Node.js, Express, and any other dependencies required to run Node.js Appications). In the "Terminal" UI, write the follow command in qoute: "node app.js". This will start the server locally on your computer. To verify that your Front-end Node.js application server is live, go to one of the follow web address from your favorite brownser: http://localhost:3000/ or http://127.0.0.1:3000/ The browser should display something along the line: "Connection Live: API Users-Account-Services uses Node.js to Collect User Data".
